We provide comprehensive and deep detailed smart contract audits which also getting fully implemented in the ecosystem and the usage of our bot.
Why perform a smart contract audit?
Performing a smart contract audit is crucial for various reasons:
Security Assurance: Smart contracts often involve the handling of valuable assets and sensitive data. Audits ensure that the code is robust and secure, reducing the risk of security breaches.
Risk Management: Identifying vulnerabilities early allows developers to mitigate potential risks before they lead to significant losses or disruptions.
User Protection: Users of the smart contract platform deserve a secure and trustworthy environment. Audits ensure that their interactions with the contract are safe.
Investor Confidence: Audits enhance investor confidence by demonstrating a commitment to security and responsible development practices.


Steps of a Smart Contract Audit:
A comprehensive smart contract audit typically involves the following steps:
Contract Review: Understanding the contract’s purpose, functions, and interactions with other systems.
Code Analysis: Reviewing the codebase for vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and potential attack vectors.
Automated Testing: Employing automated tools to identify common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, overflow, and underflow issues.
Manual Review: In-depth manual code inspection to catch vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
Security Testing: Actively testing the contract’s security measures, such as role-based access control and encryption.
Functionality Testing: Ensuring that the contract functions as intended and that all features work as expected.
External Dependency Review: Evaluating third-party libraries or code that the contract relies on.
Documentation Review: Analyzing the clarity and completeness of the contract’s documentation.
Risk Assessment: Assigning risk levels to identified vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and exploitability.
Report Generation: Compiling an audit report that includes identified issues, risk assessments, and recommendations for mitigation.
Communication with Developers: Discussing the findings with the development team to clarify issues and suggest fixes.
Remediation: Addressing identified vulnerabilities by implementing necessary changes and improvements.
Re-audit: In some cases, performing a follow-up audit to ensure that the identified issues have been adequately resolved.
By diligently following these steps, a smart contract audit can help ensure the security and reliability of the contract, minimizing risks and maximizing user trust.


Our Audit Scope
Audit Method.
Our smart contract audit is an extensive methodical examination and analysis of the smart contract’s code that is used to interact with the blockchain. Goal: discover errors, issues and security vulnaribilities in the code. Findings getting reported and improvements getting suggested.
Automatic and Manual Review
We are using automated tools to scan functions and weeknesses of the contract. Transfers, integer over-undeflow checks such as all CWE events.
Tools we use:
Visual Studio Code
CWE
SWC
Solidity Scan
SVD
 In manual code review our auditor looking at source code and performing line by line examination. This method helps to clarify developer’s coding decisions and business logic.

Frequently asked questions
How long does it take to deliver the audit?
Depending on our workload and on the audited contract complexity it takes 24-48 hours. In some cases may take up to 72hours
Where will be the report shared?
The audit report is being created in a PDF document, which is then uploaded here on the website and to github. The audit is also posted in the audit telegram channel, trending channel, lounge and to our twitter. Audited tokens receive an extra badge on the skeleton contract scanner and price bot.
